## Personal background
I am 21 years old and grew up in Paris then moved to Mulhouse, France.

A few facts about myself:

- Polyglot : French, English, Chinese, Japanese, German & Korean
- Exchange Studies 2018 Seoul, South Korea at Hanyang University (and loved it)
- Cleared CFA Level 1 Exam (Dec 2019)
- Realized my childhood dream of visiting Japan during Christmas 2018
- Team ranked 2nd of Mirage EDHEC Business Game Dec 2019 (against more than 300 competitors)
- Ran a semi-marathon in August 2019 ! Next goal ➡Full Marathon !!

Being the second generation of a family of Chinese migrants, my parents left china during their teenage years and settle in France for a better future. I believe that my education is deeply rooted to adaptation, meaning that I carry with me two cultures at the same time and this allowed me to equip myself for an ever-changing world.

My family owns a retail clothing business in Mulhouse and thanks to that I acquired skills in the management of customers, suppliers and employees. This entrepreneurial family environment shaped without a doubt an independent, hard-working and rigorous mindset, instilling patience, logic to act decisively and feel responsible for my actions. In fact, my sister and I are collaborating to launch our own jewellery brand called “Yaode” (available here : https://www.yaode.fr/).

## Educational background
I studied my undergrad in Business Administration with a major in Finance at **EDHEC Business School** from 2016 to 2019. As part of the degree, I had one semester abroad, I chose to go to **Hanyang University, Seoul South Korea**. Seoul was very different from Paris and the lifelong friends I made there definitely motivated me to study abroad for my master's degree and I was lucky enough to get admitted to **London Business School**, where I study right now.

Studying at London Business School, renowned for training the future decision-makers, is a learning opportunity that would allow me to take my career to the next level. The possibility to tailor the courses portfolio and to learn what students are curious about is very important. This flexibility would allow me to acquire strong knowledge in Derivatives and Financial Engineering. Through your workshops, I would like to improve my modelling skills. Having a deep financial background, I would also like to sharpen my coding skills: especially through Machine Learning elective. 

The programme helps student to connect with their dream employers, taking students one step closer to their career goals. The rigorous learning and wide exposure that London Business School has empowers students to find opportunities worldwide. Finally, combining the educations I obtained from two alma maters is what I perceive as a strong asset for my long-term career.

## Work experience
I have acquired a 1 year work experience during my undergraduate studies. First, I interned at **Credit du Nord Retail Banking**. In fact, I used to be part of the **KYC team**. I then joined a French software start-up. It was a unique occasion to experience how innovative idea can be implemented. After that, I joined **Credit Mutuel Asset Management**, within the **Fund Accounting division**. Finally, I joined **Société Générale Corporate and Investment Banking** as a **Product Specialist for their Quantitative Investment Strategies** department.
