<p>The inspiration for this post actually comes from a trading strategy project I was doing in my investment fundamental course. I would normally have used excel for this type of analysis, but I decided to try R and I found it to be much more powerful at analyzing the trading strategy than excel would have been. Before we start the analysis, let us look at the background of the trading strategy.</p>
<h2 id="trading-strategy">Trading strategy</h2>
<p>The Croatian economy is very dependent on tourism. In fact around 20% of the GDP is related to the tourist sector, and more than 30 million people visit the country every year. However most people visit the country during the tourist season, which runs every year from May to October. Most tourists comes from the rest of Europe, and consequently we see a large inflow of euros (and therefore outflow of the Croatian Kuno (HKR)) during the tourist season. While the HKR is pegged to the EUR, it has a band of +-15% it can move around a fixed point, and as a result we see fairly predictable exchange rate fluctuations between the HKR and the EUR every year. Some asset managers trade on these fluctuations, and I thought it would be interesting to look into whether this is a potential strategy that can be employed.</p>
<h2 id="the-optimal-strategy">The optimal strategy</h2>
<p>We want to try out two strategies: The theoretical optimal strategy and the implementable strategy. The optimal strategy will give you the return if you were able to time the market perfectly every year, while the implementable strategy is a strategy which is fairly easy to implement (but will give you lower returns). To simulate both strategies we will use R, and I will guide you as we go along on why we are doing the different things. To begin with you can see below which packages I will be using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{r}" data-lang="{r}">library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(GGally)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
library(kableExtra)
library(lubridate)
</code></pre><p>First let us read the data. Here I have downloaded <a href="https://www.hnb.hr/en/core-functions/monetary-policy/exchange-rate-list/exchange-rate-list">Croatian currency data from the last 15 years from the Croatian central bank</a>. We will be looking at the exchange rate with the EUR. Let us first load the data.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{r}" data-lang="{r}">HRK_data  &lt;-  read_xlsx(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;DailyExchangeRates_01101999-12102020.xlsx&quot;), # Loads data with excel filename
              
                         sheet=&quot;DailyExchangeRates_01101999-121&quot;,  #Name of sheet we want data from
                skip=0) # Number of rows to skip (none)
skim(HRK_data) #it is always a good idea to skim the data to get an idea of what we are working with
</code></pre><p>We will only be working with two of the variables: <code>Date</code> and <code>Middle Rate</code>. To implement the optimal strategy, what we want to do is to look at a &ldquo;tourist year&rdquo; instead of a normal year. The idea is that we want to buy HKR at the lowest point during the off-season, when the currency should be at its lowest, and sell it during the tourist season, when the currency has appreciated again. To do this we define a new column <code>t_year</code> which matches the tourist season. Our off-season will run from November 1 of every year to April 30 the next year, while the tourist season runs from 1 May to 31 October. So the tourist year of 2010 will begin on 1 November 2009 and finish on October 31 2010. Let us clean up the data a bit and then add this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{r}" data-lang="{r}">HRK_data_mod &lt;- HRK_data %&gt;%

</code></pre><p>Again 2.5% is not a lot for a mean return, but with currencies you can normally use a lot of leverage to increase your returns.</p>
<p>One question we could ask ourselves is whether this return provides significant positive returns. To do this let us create a confidence interval for the return. If 0 is part of it, we cannot say for sure the return is significant.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{r}" data-lang="{r}">HRK_optimal_summary &lt;- HRK_data_optimal %&gt;% 
  #We calculate the confidence interval 
  summarize(mean_position = format(mean(position_days), digits = 0),
            mean_return = mean(return),
            sd_return = sd(return),
            observations = n(),
            se_return = sd_return / sqrt(observations),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, observations-1),
            MoE = t_critical * se_return,
            LowerCI = mean_return - MoE,
            UpperCI = mean_return + MoE)
#Let us make the table look nice
HRK_optimal_summary %&gt;% 
  kable(caption = &quot;Annual returns from optimal trading strategy for HKR/EUR&quot;,
             col.names = c(&quot;Mean position length&quot;, &quot;Mean return (%)&quot;, &quot;Standard deviation (%)&quot;, &quot;Observations&quot;,  &quot;Standard error (%)&quot;, &quot;T critical&quot;, &quot;Margin of error (%)&quot;, &quot;Lower CI (%)&quot;, &quot;Upper CI (%)&quot;),
        digits = 4) %&gt;% 
  kable_material_dark(&quot;striped&quot;, full_width = FALSE) 
</code></pre><p>So with 95% confidence we can say the returns are significant (do note our observations are below the 25-30 we would normally want).</p>
<h2 id="implementable-strategy">Implementable strategy</h2>
<p>We just found the optimal strategy, but let us now try to do the same for the implementable strategy. What we can see in the first table we made (table 1) is that most purchase dates cluster around January and February, while most sales dates cluster around July and August. Let us therefore use the optimal trading dates we just found to find an entry and exit date for the position for every year. One way to do this would be to find the median date in the dataset.</p>

  # We want to convert the months and days for each optimal date into numbers (we do not care about the year). There is no mmdd format for lubridate, so instead we multiply the number of month by 32 (any number larger than 31 works) and add the number of the day, this way we will be able to separate days and months when we convert it back, as the remainder of 32 will be the day, and the divisor from 32 will be the month
  
  # Since our purchase period (off-season) is found between two years, we cannot just multiply the month by 32, as it would mix our periodization up (we want november to be in the beginning of the period - not the end). We therefore multiply by 32*1 if month is november, 32*2 if december, 32*3 if january and so on.

<h2 id="conclusion-and-reflections-on-r">Conclusion (and reflections on R)</h2>
<p>This was my study group first real applied data science project, i.e. a project where we have not been given instructions to use R but rather did it because the analysis would be easier to do and easier to replicate than in e.g. Excel. I think it is interesting how the business world has almost unanimously decided that Excel is the go-to software for data analytics. Excel is very good since it is much more visual than R, so it is easier for people with no coding experience to follow along excel easier. However, the replicability for excel is much lower than R, and excel does not work well with dataframes that are continuously updated (as some data cleaning may have to be done manually). Having learned basic R now, I look back and shiver at my former student jobs where I updated dashboards by manually copy-pasting and deleting different rows.</p>
